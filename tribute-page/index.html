        <h2> Here's a time line of Prophet Muhammad's life:
        </h2>
        
        <ul class="text-left">
          <li><strong>570</strong> -	 	Muhammad was born in the year 570 in the town of Mecca. He was the first and only son of Abdullah bin Al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father, Abdullah died before his birth.</li>
          <li><strong>575</strong>	 	- When Muhammad was five or six his mother took him to Yathrib, an oasis town a few hundred miles north of Mecca, to stay with relatives and visit his father's grave there. On the return journey, Amina took ill and died. Halima, his nurse, returned to Mecca with the orphaned boy and placed him in the protection of his paternal grandfather, Abdul Al-Muttalib. </li>
          <li><strong>578</strong>	 - Upon his grandfather's death in 578, Muhammad, aged about eight, passed into the care of a paternal uncle, Abu Talib.</li>
          <li><strong>580-594</strong>	 - As a young boy, Muhammad worked as a shepherd to help pay his keep (his uncle was of modest means). In his teens he sometimes traveled with Abu Talib, who was a merchant, accompanying caravans to trade centers like Syria and Yemen.</li>
          <li><strong>594</strong>		 	- Muhammad Acts as Caravan Agent for Wealthy Tradeswoman, Khadija. In his early twenties, Muhammad entered the service of a wealthy Meccan merchant, a widow named Khadija bint Khawalayd. The two were distant cousins. Muhammad carried her goods to the north and returned with a profit.</li>
          <li><strong>595-609</strong> -  Impressed by Muhammad's honesty and character, Khadija eventually proposed marriage. They were wed in about 595. He was twenty-five. She was nearly forty.
            
          Muhammad continued to manage Khadija's business affairs, and their next years were pleasant and prosperous. Six children were born to them, two sons who both died in infancy, and four daughters. Mecca prospered too, becoming a wellâ€“off trading center in the hands of an elite group of clan leaders who were mostly successful traders.</li>
          <li><strong>610</strong> -	 	
Mecca's new materialism and its traditional idolatry disturbed Muhammad. He began making long retreats to a mountain cave outside town. There, he fasted and meditated. On one occasion, after a number of indistinct visionary experiences, Muhammad was visited by an overpowering presence and instructed to recite words of such beauty and force that he and others gradually attributed them to God. This experience shook Muhammad to the core. It was several years before he dared to talk about it outside his family.</li>
          <li> 	<strong>613</strong> -	 
After several similar experiences, Muhammad finally began to reveal the messages he was receiving to his tribe. These were gathered verse by verse and later would become the Qur'an, Islam's sacred scripture. </li>
          <li><strong>622</strong>	 - 
In 622, Muhammad and his few hundred followers left Mecca and traveled to Yathrib, the oasis town where his father was buried. The leaders there were suffering through a vicious civil war, and they had invited this man well known for his wisdom to act as their mediator.</li>
          <li><strong>625-628</strong>	 - 
The Meccans did not take Muhammad's new success lightly. Early skirmishes led to three major battles in the next three years. Of these the Muslims won the first (the Battle of Badr, March, 624), lost the second (the Battle of Uhud, March, 625), and outlasted the third, (The Battle of the Trench and the Siege of Medina, April, 627).</li>
          
          <li><strong>630</strong>	 	- 
By now, the balance of power had shifted radically away from once-powerful Mecca, toward Muhammad and the Muslims. In January, 630, they marched on Mecca and were joined by tribe after tribe along the way. They entered Mecca without bloodshed and the Meccans, seeing the tide had turned, joined them.</li>
          <li><strong> 630-632	 </strong> - 

Muhammad returned to live in Medina. In the next three years, he consolidated most of the Arabian Peninsula under Islam. In March, 632, he returned to Mecca one last time to perform a pilgrimage, and tens of thousands of Muslims joined him. 

After the pilgrimage, he returned to Medina. Three months later on June 8, 632 he died there, after a brief illness. He is buried in the mosque in Medina. Within a hundred years Muhammad's teaching and way of life had spread from the remote corners of Arabia as far east as Indo-China and as far west as Morocco, France and Spain.</li>
         
        </ul>
        
        <p>Umar,  may  Allah  be  pleased  with  him reported the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) as saying: "Do not exalt me as the Christians have exalted Jesus, son of Mary. I am just His servant, so call me Allah's Servant and Messenger." </p>
